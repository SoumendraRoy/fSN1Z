A Repo to calculate the survival probability (fSN1) of the primary star following a supernova natal kick after its first mass transfer.

Description: Soumendra_Part: Contains all codes, plots: Contains all plots

In Soumendra_Part, main.ipynb: Is the main notebook, has all the maths and all the plots, including a script to generate the main plot main.pdf fSN1_Basic.ipynb: Describes how to calculate fSN1, fSN1_Binary_Param.ipynb: Varies fSN1 with intial parameters and evolution parameters, fSN1_Z.ipynb: Varies fSN1 with Z, main.ipynb also has the same.

In plots, main.pdf: Is the main plot.
